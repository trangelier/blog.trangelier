## Introduction

This post will cover how I created my Digital Ocean server, added my domain from Google Domain, configured a Reverse Proxy Nginx server, and setup NodeJS. This is also where this blog is hosted! I will go over all the steps that I took to get a Hello World NodeJS Application running. I might write up a guide on how I deploy this blog as well.

### Google Domain

First thing you want to do is tell your Google Domain about your droplet. I'm going to assume you already have a domain purchased from [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com).

First Navigate to [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com), click the sidebar and click the entry `DNS`.

At the bottom of that page, under `Custom Resource Methods` add two entries.

```
@ A 1h YOUR_DIGITAL_OCEAN_IP_ADDRESS
www CNAME 1h YOUR_DOMAIN_NAME
```

Google Domains does give you seperate fields for each of the options listed above, so make sure to use those.

This can take time to propigate to DNS servers around the world. You can check your domians status by using [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/).

### Digital Ocean

One change is required to your droplet, if you don't have a droplet yet and stumbled on this blog checkout [Digital Ocean's Documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/), it's amazing.

Once logged in:

1. Click the `Create` button on top of the navigation bar
2. Click `Domains/DNS`
3. Enter your domain name and attach it to your droplet

All done with the Digital Ocean configuration.

### Nginx

In this step, we will install Nginx to our server, install a program called [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) which will handle all the SSL configurations for us leveraging [LetsEncrpyt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

```bash
# Install Nginx
sudo dnf install nginx
# start Nginx on server reboot
sudo systemctl enable nginx.service
# start Nginx
systemctl start nginx.service
# Install cerbot for SSL
sudo dnf install certbot certbot-nginx
# Let Certbot completly configure your SSL
sudo certbot --nginx
# SELinux allow proxy_pass
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect 1
```

To enable the proxy pass, edit your config file at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and add the following above the `server` block created by certbot:

```nginx
# the IP(s) on which your node server is running. I chose port 8080.
upstream app_yourdomain {
    server 127.0.0.1:8080;
    keepalive 8;
}
```

Also, add this into the `server` block that certbot created. Create or replace the existing `location` block with this:

```nginx
    # pass the request to the node.js server with the correct headers
    # and much more can be added, see nginx config options
    location / {
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
      proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;
      # If you want Nginx to handle websockets as well, uncomment the following:
      #proxy_http_version 1.1;
      #proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      #proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

      proxy_pass http://app_yourdomain/;
      proxy_redirect off;
    }
```

Finally, restart Nginx:

```
nginx systemctl restart nginx
```

### NVM = NodeJS & NPM

Now that we have Nginx looking for a NodeJS Server running on port 8080 let's install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) which will allow us to install any version of NodeJS we want. I generally install the latest stable release unless my project has specific requirements.

```bash

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
# Install the Latest Stable Release and use it
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

### Test NodeJS Application

Now that we have NVM installed, which installed NodeJS and NPM for us, we have a Reverse Proxy Nginx Server ready to talk to an application running on port 8080, lets give it one!

First, create a new folder for our test.

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
```

Now lets create a simple NodeJS Server Application that simply returns Hello World. I always use vim, but feel free to use your own editor:

```bash
vim hello.js
```

Paste the following into the file:

```js
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
	res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
	res.end('Hello World\n');
}).listen(8080, 'APP_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS');
console.log('Server running at http://APP_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS:8080/');
```

Be sure to replace APP_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS with your Digital Ocean's IP Address.

Quick detour:

Now we will install PM2, which is a process manager for Node.js applications. PM2 provides an easy way to manage and daemonize applications (run them as a service).

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
# Configure PM2 on startup
pm2 startup systemd
```

After running `pm2 startup systemd` you should see the console give you a command to run, please run that command as it finalizes the startup of pm2.

Finally:

Now that we have PM2 installed, we can finally start our test application:

```bash
pm2 start hello.js
```

Finally go to your domain and you should see Hello World!!
